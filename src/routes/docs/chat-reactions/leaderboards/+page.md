## types of chat reaction leaderboards

### server stats

first of all, there are your server leaderboards which track stats for your servers only. you can
access this with `$cr lb`

these stats can be reset by server admins at any time and are not related to anything outside of the
server.

### speed stats

speed statistics are only affected by **randomly started chat reactions**. to view the leaderboard
you can do `$top cr/crdaily (global)`.

when you get a new leaderboard position nypsi will notify you with a message in chat

## resetting server leaderboards

to reset your server's leaderboards, use `$cr stats reset`
