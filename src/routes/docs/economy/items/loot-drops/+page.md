## how do they spawn?

loot drops will spawn randomly when there is activity in a channel. the more people that are active in the same channel, the higher probability that one will spawn

you may find that the commands channel in the [official nypsi server](https://discord.gg/hJTDNST) is active enough for them to spawn frequently

## rewards

the reward for loot drops is randomly generated from a list of allowed items, in a similar way that scratch card rewards are decided
