## how are they generated?

the leaderboards that you can see on the [website](https://nypsi.xyz/leaderboard) and in the bot (`$top`) are generated in real time, fetching data from the database as you request it

## stats

the leaderboard positions shown in `$stats lb` command is not real time information, this is updated hourly by the bot or whenever someone fetches a global leaderboard.
