<DocsTemplate title='own punishments' />

you can view your own active punishments (mutes and bans) on the [punishments page](https://nypsi.xyz/me/punishments). or by clicking the button in the auto response in the nypsi bot's dms.

please note that this will only show where you have been muted/banned in the server with nypsi, if it wasn't with nypsi, we don't have access to that data and it can't be shown.
