<DocsTemplate title='punishments' description="" />

if you break the [bot rules](https://nypsi.xyz/rules) you could be banned from using certain commands on nypsi.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="economy bans" />

an economy ban (commonly called 'ecoban') is the most common type of bot punishment. it prevents the user from being able to perform economy commands or any related actions to the economy side of nypsi until the ban is over.

these bans are linked to [alts](https://nypsi.xyz/wiki/moderation/alt-punish) based on the [official nypsi server](https://nypsi.xyz/discord).

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="getting unbanned" />

the only way to have an ecoban be removed is to prove that you didn't do what you've been accused of, [buying an unban](https://ko-fi.com/s/1d78b621a5) or waiting for it to expire.

if the ban expires after the end of a [season](https://nypsi.xyz/wiki/economy/seasons), the user will get a **full profile reset**, rather than just a normal end of season reset.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="blacklist" />

a blacklist is usually the end of nypsi for that user. a blacklist prevents any and all interaction with the bot, including support requests. blacklists are very rarely given out, only when it's truly deserved. usually for **very** constant rule breaking, annoying staff, or threatening behaviour.
