<DocsTemplate title='auto mute' description="configure auto mute in nypsi to automatically mute members for chat violations. learn how to set durations, use $automute, and manage violation levels." />

auto mute will be configured by default to mute members for an increasing amount of time when they
violate the chat filter

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="configuring auto mute" />

auto mute can be configured using the `$automute` command, values of '0' will not mute the user at
that violation level, however setting a value of 'none', will use the next lowest available time.

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="vl expire" />

this is the amount of time it takes for filter violations to expire. for example, if set to 1 day,
the amount of punishments a user has received from automute will be reset, so they will start from
VL 0.

the [nypsi server](https://discord.gg/hJTDNST) uses an expiry of 30 days

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="how violation levels work" />

each hour, a member's violation level will be reset. every time they violate the chat filter they vl
(violations) will go up by one.

if their vl has a hit against the auto mute configuration, they will be muted for that amount of
time. if there is no value associated with their current vl level, nypsi will use the next lowest
available option.
