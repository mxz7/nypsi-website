<DocsTemplate title="nypsi documentation" description="nypsi documentation provides setup guides, general info, and tips for the nypsi discord bot. contribute updates via github or get help in the discord server. learn how to improve or update the docs easily." />

welcome to the nypsi documentation, or some may call it the _wiki_. here you can find information to help you get nypsi set up, or to just read up on general information.

considering that you've found yourself here, you're smarter than most nypsi users, good job!

<DocsHeader header='h2' anchor='contributing' text='contributing' />

pssst, if you think that some information is lacking, out of date, or could generally be improved. this is all open source and you can contribute at <a href="https://github.com/mxz7/nypsi-website" target="_blank">github.com/mxz7/nypsi-website</a>. if you're unsure where to start, ask a staff member, or someone that seems smart, in the <a href="https://nypsi.xyz/discord" target="_blank">nypsi discord server</a>.

the docs will be found in the folder: `src/routes/docs`. if you know markdown or are even a little bit nerdy, you should be able to figure everything out based on the other files. good luck and thank you ❤️
