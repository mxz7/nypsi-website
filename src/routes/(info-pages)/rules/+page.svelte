    <h2>bot rules</h2>

    <h3>automating commands</h3>
    <p>this is not allowed. use of this will result in a ban and potentially a profile reset.</p>

    <h3>exploits</h3>
    <p>including sharing of bugs/exploits is not allowed. you will be banned.</p>
    <p>
      if you have found an exploit or potentially serious issue please contact <a
        href="https://discord.com/users/672793821850894347"
        target="_blank"
        class="link">@max.z</a
      >
    </p>

    <h3>trading</h3>
    <p>
      trading things outside of nypsi is allowed, but <span class="font-bold">at your own risk</span
      >. it's recommended to find a trusted middleman for this.
    </p>

    <p>
      scamming is <span class="font-bold">not allowed</span>. if you have been scammed, dm nypsi
      with the following screenshots: trade agreement, the trade, and refusal.
    </p>

    <p>
      the exception to this is gambling with other players, such as with coinflips and roll. this is
      not protected and at your own risk, if you don't want to be scammed, use a middleman or use
      safe bets within your maxbet.
    </p>

    <h3>auctions</h3>
    <p>
      auctions are for selling items to players, not for transferring items between your accounts.
      there's a command for that you imbecile.
    </p>

    <p>
      creating auctions/offers with a ridiculous value with the intent to disrupt the value of a
      given item is not allowed.
    </p>

    <h3>don't be a prick</h3>
    <p>
      this gives staff leniency to ban for things that may not necessarily be on here but are still
      deserving of a ban. generally, most people don't ever get banned unless they break one of the
      above rules.
    </p>

    <h2 id="server">nypsi discord server rules</h2>

    <h3>discord terms of service</h3>
    <p>
      you must follow discord's terms of service. breaking these rules puts the server at risk, so
      you will be removed.
    </p>

    <h3>threats</h3>
    <p>
      threatening to dox, ddos, swat or any other serious illegal activity is not allowed. joking
      about it is <span class="italic">okay</span>, assuming you are on very good terms with each
      other, but best to not at all.
    </p>

    <h3>harassment</h3>
    <p>
      continuous harassment and annoyance of other users is not allowed, this is annoying and
      childish behaviour.
    </p>

    <h3>don't be a prick</h3>
    <p>
      again, this gives staff the leniancy to punish users when it is deserved but may not
      necessarily be one of the above rules. but as always, be a normal respectable person and you
      will have no problem. the server is relatively unmoderated and relaxed.
