<DocsTemplate title='portals' description="discover how to obtain and use nether and end portals to mine, hunt, and get rare items in other dimensions. learn crafting, buying, and effects." />

portals allow you to [mine or hunt](/docs/economy/fish-hunt-mine) in other dimensions to get more valuable items.
there are two kinds of portals: <ItemModal item="nether_portal">nether portal</ItemModal> and <ItemModal item="end_portal">end portal.</ItemModal>

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="obtaining" />

you can get nether portal by crafting with 10 obsidian obtained from mining. you can also buy from other players or get from certain scratch card.
you can get end portal by crafting with 12 eyes of ender which can be obtained from crafting. you can also buy it from other players.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="using" />

portals automatically activate randomly while you are hunting or mining if you have them in your inventory. the effects don't stack meaning they don't get better if you have more.
