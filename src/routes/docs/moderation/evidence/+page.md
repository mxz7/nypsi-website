<DocsTemplate title='evidence' description="securely upload, store, and manage evidence for nypsi moderation cases with long-term access, direct case attachment, and easy storage upgrades." />

evidence is a system that allows moderators to upload evidence to a nypsi moderation case

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="what's the point?" />

instead of uploading your evidence to discord in a channel, this will ensure that your evidence is
never deleted, unless you delete it. it is also directly attached to the case, accessible by
clicking a button after using the `$case` command, which means less context switching if you keep
your evidence in a specific channel

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="secure storage" />

evidence is stored in a secure object storage bucket with a long name of random characters.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="adding evidence to a case" />

when you do the `$case` command, there will be an evidence button to either view evidence, or to add
evidence.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="getting more storage" />

to get more storage you can contact `@m.axz` on discord.
