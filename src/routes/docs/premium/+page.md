<DocsTemplate title='premium ranks' description="discover nypsi discord bot premium ranks ‚Äî learn how to purchase, access benefits, manage credits, get premium crates, and buy items via ko-fi." />

i love you

please note that when you buy anything from the online store, you **MUST** set your email with `/settings me email`. when you buy from ko-fi, the bot only knows the email address that was used. you must set your email to receive your purchased items.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="what is premium?" />

premium is for users that would like to donate some money to the creator of nypsi. in return, you
receive benefits that give extra usability, faster commands and most importantly... bigger penises
with `/pp`

but really, premium is what funds nypsi. without premium members, nypsi wouldn't be able to exist. thank you (:

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="how do i get premium?" />

the easiest way to get premium membership is by subscribing on
[ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/tekoh/tiers). you can also use your discord nitro subscription to boost
the [official nypsi server](/discord), which will gain you certain benefits.

there are other payment methods, such as direct payment via crypto. if you're interested, contact
`@m.axz`.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="credits" />

credits work with the `expire date` which can be seen in the output of the `$premium` command. the expire date is handled by a premium subscription with the store, the credits are handled by premium credit items, which can be found in crates, scratch cards etc.

once the expire date has been passed, credits will be used every day. if you have no credits and the expire date is passed, your premium will expire.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="when do i get my premium crates?" />

premium crates are automatic on friday nights / saturday mornings (00:10 GMT/UTC)

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="buying items" />

you can buy crates from the online store too in a very similar fashion. just make sure to set your email with `/settings me email` on the bot once you've bought stuff.
