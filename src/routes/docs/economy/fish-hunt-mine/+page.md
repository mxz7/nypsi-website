<DocsTemplate title='fish hunt mine' description="learn how to obtain and upgrade fishing rods, pickaxes, and guns in fish hunt mine using crates, shop, boosters, and manage item durability efficiently." />

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="obtaining" />

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="crates" />

[crates](/docs/economy/items/crates) is the main way that most people get their items, tools included. the best way to get crates as a beginner is to `/vote` twice daily. a higher vote streak allows you to get more crates at a time.

make sure you don't lose your vote streak by enabling vote reminders! `/settings me notifications`

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="shop" />

you can buy the lowest tier of tools in the shop (`$shop` & `/buy`). these are pretty basic but still allow you to grind and start to earn money.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="different levels of item" />

the fishing rod, pickaxe and gun have different item ratings, terrible, normal and incredible for fishing rods and guns and wooden, iron and diamond for pickaxes. the difference between these is how many of these you receive each time you find one in a crate, the amount of items you can get as well as what rarity items you will
receive.

higher level guns, pickaxes and fishing rods make it easier to find items that have a higher rarity rating. you can also use [boosters](/docs/economy/items/crates?crate=boosters) like efficiency, fortune, worm etc to get better items.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="durability" />

in your inventory there's a number next to every item to indicate how many of those items you have, in the case for guns, pickaxes and
fishing rods, this number is used to indicate how many times you can hunt / fish / mine before you need to find more guns / fishing
rods / pickaxes. if you use an unbreaking, it will allow you to use tools without the number going down for an hour.
