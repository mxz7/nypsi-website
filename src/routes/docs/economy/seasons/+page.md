a nypsi season will typically last 6 months. at the end of the season, an _economy reset_ takes place, where
everything **except prestige, achievements, tags and karma** is reset for every user. any banned users will also be unbanned, but
will be completely reset. meaning prestige 0.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="why?" />

its a good way to keep economy fresh and under control ðŸ™‚. and at the end of every season, the top 5 balances globally get
rewards, such as nypsi premium & real money

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="rewards" />

typically, the top 10 will receive rewards, all of which including a form of [premium membership](/docs/premium).
