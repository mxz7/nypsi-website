# nypsi

### 🍟 url
currently not launched ~ still in development

### 🍪 why
at the time of writing, the only website for nypsi is [`bot.tekoh.wtf`](http://bot.tekoh.wtf), which redirects to the invite page<br>
creating this website will give the bot its own page to showcase features in a nicer format than possible with markdown on top.gg and github
