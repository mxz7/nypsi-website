<DocsTemplate title='rules' />

if you're a respectable person and use common sense, you should be fine

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="bot roles" />

these rules apply to usage of the discord bot

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="automating commands / cheating" anchor="automating-commands-cheating" />

'cheating', by automating commands, using a macro, multiple people on the same account etc. is not allowed. you will be banned and potentially have your profile reset.

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="exploits" />

including sharing of bugs/exploits is not allowed. you will be banned.

if you have found an exploit or potentially serious issue please contact [@m.axz](https://discord.com/users/672793821850894347)

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="trading" />

trading things outside of nypsi is allowed, but **can be incredibly risky**. it's recommended to find a trusted middleman for this. if you have been scammed, make a support request with nypsi and our staff can help you out.

scamming is **not allowed**. if you have been scammed, dm nypsi with the following screenshots: trade agreement, the trade, and refusal.

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="market" />

[the market](/docs/economy/market) is for selling items to players, not for transferring items between your accounts.
there's a command for that you imbecile.

creating orders/offers with a ridiculous value with the intent to disrupt the value of a
given item is not allowed.

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="don't be a prick" />

this gives staff leniency to ban for things that may not necessarily be on here but are still
deserving of a ban. generally, most people don't ever get banned unless they break one of the
above rules.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="nypsi discord server rules" />

these rules apply to the [official nypsi discord server](/discord) **only**

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="discord terms of service" />

you must follow discord's terms of service. breaking these rules puts the server at risk, so
you will be removed.

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="threats" />

threatening to dox, ddos, swat or any other serious illegal activity is not allowed. joking
about it is _okay_, assuming you are on very good terms with each
other, but best to not at all.

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="harassment" />

continuous harassment and annoyance of other users is not allowed, this is annoying and
childish behaviour.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="don't be a prick" />

again, this gives staff the leniancy to punish users when it is deserved but may not
necessarily be one of the above rules. but as always, be a normal respectable person and you
will have no problem. the server is relatively unmoderated and relaxed.
