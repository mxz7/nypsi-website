i love you

please note that when you buy anything from the online store, you **MUST** set your email with `/settings me email`. when you buy from ko-fi, the bot only knows the email address that was used. you must set your email to receive your purchased items.

## what is premium?

premium is for users that would like to donate some money to the creator of nypsi. in return, you
receive benefits that give extra usability, faster commands and most importantly... bigger penises
with `/pp`

but really, premium is what funds nypsi. without premium members, nypsi wouldn't be able to exist. thank you (:

## how do i get premium?

the easiest way to get premium membership is by subscribing on
[ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/tekoh/tiers). you can also use your discord nitro subscription to boost
the [official nypsi server](/discord), which will gain you certain benefits.

there are other payment methods, such as direct payment via crypto. if you're interested, contact
`@m.axz`.

## when do i get my premium crates

premium crates are automatic on friday nights / saturday mornings (00:15 GMT/UTC)

## buying items

you can buy crates from the online store too in a very similar fashion. just make sure to set your email with `/settings me email` on the bot once you've bought stuff.
