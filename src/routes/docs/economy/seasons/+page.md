## what are seasons?

a nypsi season will typically last 6 months. at the end of the season, an _economy reset_ takes place, where
everything **except prestige, achievements, tags and karma** is reset for every user. any banned users will also be unbanned, but
will be completely reset. meaning prestige 0.

## why?

its a good way to keep economy fresh and under control ðŸ™‚. and at the end of every season, the top 5 balances globally get
rewards, such as nypsi premium & real money

## what are the rewards?

typically, the top 10 will receive rewards, all of which including a form of [premium membership](/docs/premium).

the top 5 will receive **real money**. this can be withdrawn in a number of ways:

- online purchase
- spent in nypsi shop
- gift cards
- cryptocurrency

paypal / bank transfer or similar cannot be used to withdraw funds.
