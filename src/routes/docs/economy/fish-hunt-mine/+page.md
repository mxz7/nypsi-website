<DocsTemplate title='fish hunt mine' description="learn how to obtain, upgrade and optimally use fishing rods, pickaxes, and guns in fish hunt mine using crates, shop, boosters, and manage item durability efficiently." />

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="obtaining" />

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="crates" />

[crates](/docs/economy/items/crates) is the main way that most people get their items, tools included. the best way to get crates as a beginner is to `/vote` twice daily. a higher vote streak allows you to get more crates at a time.

make sure you don't lose your vote streak by enabling vote reminders! `/settings me notifications`

<DocsHeader header='h3' text="shop" />

you can buy the lowest tier of tools in the shop (`$shop` & `/buy`). these are pretty basic but still allow you to grind and start to earn money.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="different levels of item" />

the fishing rod, pickaxe and gun have different item ratings, terrible, normal and incredible for fishing rods and guns and wooden, iron and diamond for pickaxes. the difference between these is how many of these you receive each time you find one in a crate, the amount of items you can get as well as what rarity items you will
receive.

higher level guns, pickaxes and fishing rods make it easier to find items that have a higher rarity rating. 

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="durability" />

in your inventory there's a number next to every item to indicate how many of those items you have, in the case for guns, pickaxes and
fishing rods, this number is used to indicate how many times you can hunt / fish / mine before you need to find more guns / fishing
rods / pickaxes. 

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="portals" />

there are two additonal [portals](/docs/economy/items/portals) you can use to increase the number of unique items that can be mined while using pickaxes.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="unbreakings" />

unbreakings in combination with a slew of other boosters are one of the most effective ways to make money in nypsi, utliziing fish, hunt and mine as well as a series of boosters over a time period of 30 minutes.

to maximize profits with unbreakings, it's recommended to use (1) extended magazine, (1) worm, (3) fortune, (3) efficiency, (3) apple juice, (2) redbull, (1) unbreaking, as well as the top tier of fishing rods, guns and pickaxes. you can additonally use (2) looting and (1) doublexp to further maximize xp and money gain. to learn more about these, you can visit [boosters](/docs/economy/items/crates?crate=boosters) which contains direct links to each booster that is referenced above. additonally, any tier of [premium](/docs/premium) helps your command cooldown greatly, platinum being the best.

the referenced boosters will last for a total of 30 minutes, except the worm and extended magazine last for 1 hour.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="sell all" />

to sell the items gained from fish, hunt and mine, use the command `/sell all` to view all the items and their worth. you can boost your sell multiplier, which increases the sell value of the items in `/sell all` via the following [boosters](/docs/economy/items/crates?crate=boosters), [premium](/docs/premium), [guild shop](/docs/economy/guilds) and [levelling/prestiging](docs/economy/level)
