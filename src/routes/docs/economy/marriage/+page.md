<DocsHeader header='h2' text="how to get married" />

there are two ways to get married, you can either use a <ItemModal item="ring">ring</ItemModal>, or you can attempt to get 100% love with the `/love` command.

to get married with a ring, do `/marry <@user>`, they will have to accept the marriage. if they deny the marriage, you will lose your ring and receive a broken ring.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="divorces" />

sadly.. sometimes marriages don't always work out. if you get a divorce, both lovebirds will receive a broken ring in reminder of the once true love 💔.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="rewards" />

when married, you get doubled daily streak rewards when you both do `/daily`, on valentine's day there is also a bonus for married players.

there is an [achievement](/docs/economy/achievements) for getting married.
