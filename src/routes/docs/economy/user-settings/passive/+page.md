## what is passive mode

enabling passive mode allows you to not be robbed or attacked by other players, at the expense of reduced multiplier, xp gain and cookie production

## how to enable it

there is a 20 minute cooldown on enabling and disabling passive mode to prevent abuse.

```
/settings me passive on/off
```
