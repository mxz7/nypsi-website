<DocsTemplate title='karma' description="learn how to earn and use karma in nypsi to buy exclusive rewards like xp, crates, and premium ranks in the limited-time karma shop." />

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="how to get karma" />

karma is earned passively while using commands with nypsi.

to check how much karma you have, use the `/karma` command.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="what is karma used for" />

karma is used in the karma shop that is opened periodically to purchase rewards such as xp, crates, and premium ranks.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="karma shop" />

while the karma shop is opened, it can be viewed using the `/karmashop view` command.

to purchase an item, use the command below.

```
/karmashop buy <item>
```

items on the karma shop have a limited stock, so make sure to buy them before stock runs out.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="how often is the karma shop open" />

the karma shop opens a few times a month, use the `/karmashop view` command to see when it is next scheduled to be opened. **please note** that these times are generated at random by nypsi for fairness.
