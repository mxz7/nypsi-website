<DocsTemplate title='seasons' description="learn about nypsi seasons: periodic economy resets, prestige and rewards, top player prizes including premium membership and real money via safe methods." />

a nypsi season will typically last 6 months. at the end of the season, an _economy reset_ takes place, where
everything except what is in the below list, is reset for every user. any banned users will also be unbanned, but
will be completely reset. meaning prestige 0.

<DocsHeader header='h2' text='what stays?' />

- premium
- prestige
- daily streak
- vote streak
- marriage
- dabloons
- gold stars

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="why?" />

its a good way to keep economy fresh and under control 🙂. and at the end of every season, the people at the top of the global balance leaderboard get rewards, such as nypsi premium & real money

<DocsHeader header='h2' text="rewards" />

typically, the top 10 will receive rewards, all of which including a form of [premium membership](/docs/premium).

the top 5 will receive **real money**. this can be withdrawn in a number of ways:

- online purchase
- spent in nypsi shop
- gift cards
- cryptocurrency

paypal / bank transfer or similar cannot be used to withdraw funds.
